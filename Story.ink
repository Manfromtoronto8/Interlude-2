 "how much for the pot" he asks
 What price do you give him?

 * Charge him 5 extra gold coins (15 gold coins total) ->extra 

=same_price
"10 gold coins good sir!"
"Wow what a good price I would've paid 20 coins for it!"
You're shocked as no one you know has money to spare like that
"Of course sir, best prices in the business
"Good to know I will definantly be coming back. My wife loves clay designs."
Just as he came he leaves a stranger, although he has piqued your interest ->next_day
