For this interlude, I used the service Inky to create a game based on the pathways for men in Turkish Villiage, as the name *Köy* means villiage in Turkish. The game features two choices, a warrior or a merchant, and provides the subjective story based upon these professions. For this reflection, I used the questions in your slides such as "How do the limitations in game platform affect the experience ?" and "what does it mean to "play" history?" to guide the analysis on game design, limitations, and perspective on my game

The first question used to analyse my game is "How do the limitations in game platform affect the experience ?" (*History is a Remix*, 2022) I believe that the limitations in the gaming platform heavily affect the experience as my game is heavily based on the users ability to visualize and imagine scenarios to make decisions, as no visual aid is present. As well, the game is heavily predicated on social rules of Turkish villages that the user may be unaware of. As Johan Huizinga mentions play comes before socialization (Nyugen, 2020), and I used this game similarily to teach rules of these villiages. One option in the game is to be a low ranking warrior, and one of the options is to talk back to your superior which ultimatly lands you in the dungeon. While not necessarily the intention, the game forces the user to respect their superior in order to survive another day, and ultimatly gain respect from their village. Similarily to other games, this game forces the user to recognize your rank within the given society and to tread carefully similar to normal life, although with more dire consequences. It teaches the user the social rules of that time, although unfair it sheds light to how individuals interacted at that time and how important respect was within that society. Another limitation I felt in this game was the ability to provide different or multiple obstacles to the user like in other gaming services. As Bernard Suits mentions that to play a game is to take up uneccesary obstacles for the sake of the activity (Nyugen, 2020). I agree with Suits as the games we create as a class do not necessarily have an impact on the real world, however the obstacles created in the Inky software may become boring for the user. In my experience using Inky, the game is not able to provide "game-type" features such as variables that are dependent on what the user chooses, but are independent of where the user is in the story. In contrast to Twine, the Inky service seems to be more of a storyline/adventure than an actual game, which creates limitations especially in scenes such as battles where a variable such as "health" may be easier and more efficent than creating multiple thread in Inky.

The second question I used to guide my analysis of my game is "what does it mean to "play" history?" (*Theories of Play*, 2022) In my belief, I think "playing" history is to provide a correct backdrop or context to the history being used, and to use the "grey" areas within history to create and imagine different scenarios. However, I also want to speak on the positionality of a game and how that affects the ways we see and "play" history. As Jayanth mentions in her Ted Talk "Game Design in the Imperial Mode #CGSA 2022’", similar to the modern reader, game design is created for "the “model player” that is imagined by the game’s designers as we encode meaning into the work. The “model player” of the video game is a white man."(Jayanth, 2021) While my game may not be created through a white lens as it is based upon a Turkish villiage and plays heavily on individual communication, the work is based upon a male perspective in this society. When creating the game, I thought about this point and it made me question how equitable my perspective is on this game to people other than men. As I created a "warrior" and "merchant" class, I could have created another class geared towards more feminine roles in that society. However, I felt these roles were boring and would not engage the user in the game, however that conception is based on my own affinity to certain games that do not reflect the majority. For example, I find the game "Candy Crush" to be boring to me, however it was the number one game on the Apple Store for several months, showing its popularity. I find the perspective of the game developer affects how we "play" history as it may omit or ignore important aspects of history that could be fun if exposed correctly. This game was predicated on the show *Ertugrul*, which is a turkish show which follows a villiage in Turkey, in particular a warrior by the name of Ertugrul and his journey's. Similar to the show, respect is a commanding force within the village, especially since Ertugrul's father is the leader of the village, and I wanted to show how important respect was in these villages. In the show, Ertugrul is disrespected a number of times by his father and other older people in the village however he always showed respect, and I wanted to emulate that cultural significance in my game. The film "Everything is a Remix" reigns true in this regard as its mantre "copying, transforming, combining" verything is a Remix, 2015) was used in my game. I was able to use my background knowledge of Turkish villages to structure my game, and was able to complete the rest of my game by using the grey parts of that society, effectivly in my veiw being able to "play" history of a 13th century Turkish village.

The third question I used to examine my game is "are there some kinds of transmedia experiences more suited to enchantment of history than others?"(*History is a Remix*, 2022) and I noticed that within the game service realm that Twine was a better game mode to enchant history than the Inky software, because of its ability to add game dynamics and visual aids to guide the readers understanding. In using Inky, I found that the game service provided games that were geared for a "choose your own adventure", where the game developer can tell a story that is engaging but is ultimatly intended for a stagnent and more attentive audience. I found it better for more imaginative historical realities or very perspective based gameplay, in that the user is meant to go through the story exactly how the developer designed it (i.e., for the dragon flip to page 5, for the cave flip to page 3). It forces the user into a box, where there is a set storyline and the users adventure is based upon which storyline they choose. However, I found that Twine was able to overcome this by adding game dynamics such as user variables  or images to give the reader a visualizing backdrop, but also to keep the user more engaged with dynamics of the history that can be added, for example a war game that includes "Army Health" as a variable instead of just going through choices as a general that provides new storylines. This way, the user is able to understand the "soft" side of history, which can show the multitude of issues that a community faced instead of a linear storyline. In contrast, I feel like VAR may be a better medium to enchant history, as it takes away much of the guesswork in visualizing history that may be incorrect in historical fact. It reminds me of when I went to Venice and saw many places that reminded me of the game Assasins Creed 2, where I could appreciate the history of Venice because I was given the background knowledge through an RPG game. The game's immersiveness helped me to be more engaged in Italian history which translated to a new found admiration for Italian architecture and other parts of Italian culture. However, without the intial visual, audio, and physical engagment with Assasins Creed, this apprectiation may have been lost. The use of VAR, as seen in class, can throw users into the heart of a historical fiction, giving more time to the user to explore the wonders of the historical time without the rigidness of a video game.

In conclusion, the game I made on Inky opened my eyes when compared to these readings, as I did not realize these aspects were in my game until I read and related it back to my work. Especially the film "Everything is a Remix" changed my definition on ingenuity and creativity, as I found these characteristics to be out of reach for me. However, in creating this game by using the background of *Ertugrul*, I emulated great thinkers by copying, transforming, and combining the works of Middle East and Turkish culture as well as my knowledge on game design. This interlude opened my eyes on the perspectives that go into a game, and how that shapes both user experience and the social culture of cames
